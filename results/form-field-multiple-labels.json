  "input_type": "The issue with the code snippet is that it lacks a corresponding label element, which is necessary for accessibility. The correct version of the code snippet should include a label element that is associated with the input element using the \"for\" attribute or by wrapping the input element within the label element. For example:\n\n<label for=\"checkbox\">Checkbox Label</label>\n<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"checkbox\">",
  "input_name_style_type": "The issue with the code snippet is that it only contains an input field without any associated label element. This can cause problems for users who rely on screen readers or have other accessibility needs. \n\nA corrected version of the code snippet with an associated label element would be:\n\n<label for=\"email\">Email:</label>\n<input id=\"email\" name=\"email\" style=\"height: 3rem\" type=\"email\"> \n\nThis version includes a label element that is associated with the input field using the \"for\" attribute and a matching \"id\" attribute on the input field. This will make it easier for users with accessibility needs to understand the purpose of the input field.",
  "select_name": "The issue with the code snippet is that it is missing the corresponding label element(s) for the select field. This can make it difficult for users who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies to understand the purpose of the select field.\n\nThe correct version of the code snippet would include a label element that is associated with the select field using the \"for\" attribute. For example:\n\n<label for=\"select-field\">Select an option:</label>\n<select name=\"select-field\">\n  <option value=\"option1\">Option 1</option>\n  <option value=\"option2\">Option 2</option>\n  <option value=\"option3\">Option 3</option>\n</select>",
  "textarea_aria-required_name": "The issue with the code snippet is that it only contains a single label element for multiple form fields. This can cause confusion for users with assistive technology as they may not know which form field the label is referring to. \n\nThe correct version of the code snippet should include a separate label element for each form field, with the `for` attribute linking it to the corresponding form field. For example:\n\n<label for=\"textarea1\">Textarea Label:</label>\n<textarea aria-required=\"true\" name=\"...\" id=\"textarea1\"></textarea>"
