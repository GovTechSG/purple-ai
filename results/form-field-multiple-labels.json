This can cause confusion for users with assistive technology as they may not know which form field the label is referring to. \n\nThe correct version of the code snippet should include a separate label element for each form field, with the `for` attribute linking it to the corresponding form field. For example:\n\n<label for=\"textarea1\">Textarea Label:</label>\n<textarea aria-required=\"true\" name=\"...\" id=\"textarea1\"></textarea>",
