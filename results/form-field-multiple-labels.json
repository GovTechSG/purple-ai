  "input_type": "The issue with the code snippet is that it lacks a corresponding label element, which is necessary for accessibility. The correct version of the code snippet should include a label element that is associated with the input element using the \"for\" attribute or by wrapping the input element within the label element. For example:\n\n<label for=\"checkbox\">Checkbox Label</label>\n<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"checkbox\">",
  "input_name_style_type": "The issue with the code snippet is that it only contains an input field without any associated label element. This can cause problems for users who rely on screen readers or have other accessibility needs. \n\nA corrected version of the code snippet with an associated label element would be:\n\n<label for=\"email\">Email:</label>\n<input id=\"email\" name=\"email\" style=\"height: 3rem\" type=\"email\"> \n\nThis version includes a label element that is associated with the input field using the \"for\" attribute and a matching \"id\" attribute on the input field. This will make it easier for users with accessibility needs to understand the purpose of the input field."
