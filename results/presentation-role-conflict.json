{
  "button_role_type_i": "The issue in the code snippet is that the button has a \"presentation\" role, which means it should not have any semantic meaning or interactivity. However, it has a \"button\" type and it may also contain global ARIA or tabindex attributes, which contradicts the \"presentation\" role.\n\nA correct version of the code snippet should remove the \"presentation\" role and allow the button to have its default semantic meaning:\n\n```html\n<button type=\"button\"><i></i></button>\n```\n\nIf the intention was to have a presentational element without interactivity, you should use a different element, like a `div` or a `span`, and remove any global ARIA or tabindex attributes:\n\n```html\n<span role=\"presentation\"><i></i></span>\n```",
  "img_alt_role_src_style_tabindex": "The issue in this code snippet is that the `img` element has a presentational role (empty `alt` attribute) but also has global ARIA attributes (`role=\"button\"`) and `tabindex=\"0\"`.\n\nTo fix the accessibility issue, you can create a separate button element to handle the interaction and wrap the `img` element inside it. Here's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```html\n<button style=\"background: none; border: none; padding: 0; cursor: pointer;\" tabindex=\"0\">\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"...\" style=\"margin-left: -12px; margin-top: -41px; width: 25px; height: 41px; transform: translate3d(538px, 200px, 0px); z-index: 200;\">\n</button>\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the `img` element is purely presentational, and the interaction is handled by the `button` element. This improves accessibility and ensures that the element works as expected for keyboard users and screen reader users.",
  "li_role_tabindex": "The issue in the provided code snippet is that the element with a presentational role should not have global ARIA attributes or tabindex. In this case, the 'li' element has a role of \"presentation\" but also has a tabindex attribute.\n\nTo fix the issue, you can remove the tabindex attribute. The correct version of the code snippet should be:\n\n`<li role=\"presentation\"></li>`",
  "ul_aria-live_role_style": "The issue in this code snippet is that the `ul` element is marked as presentational with the attribute `role=\"presentation\"`, but it also has global ARIA attributes `aria-live=\"off\"` and a `tabindex` attribute. Presentational elements should not have global ARIA attributes or a tabindex.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```html\n<ul role=\"presentation\" style=\"transform: translateX(0px);\"></ul>\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the `aria-live` and `tabindex` attributes have been removed, as they are not needed for a presentational element.",
  "a_href_role_tabindex": "The issue in this code snippet is that the anchor element (`<a>`) is marked as presentational using `role=\"presentation\"` but still has global ARIA attributes like `tabindex`.\n\nA correct version of the code snippet would be:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"...\"></a>\n```\n\nBy removing the `role=\"presentation\"` and `tabindex=\"-1\"` attributes, the anchor element will function as expected and not cause any accessibility issues.",
  "figure_aria-label_role_style": "The issue with this code snippet is that `aria-label` and `role` are being used on an element that is marked as presentational. This can cause confusion for assistive technology users and may not provide the intended accessibility benefits. \n\nThe correct version of the code snippet would be to remove the `aria-label` and `role` attributes and add an `alt` attribute to the `img` element within the `figure` element, like so: \n\n<`figure` `style`=\"background-image:url('/media/67840/eu-budget-timing-in-focus-01.png')\">\n  <`img` `src`=\"/media/67840/eu-budget-timing-in-focus-01.png\" `alt`=\"Description of the image\">\n</figure>",
  "svg_aria-label_role_tabindex": "The issue with this code snippet is that it contains an element marked as presentational (`role=\"presentation\"`) but also has global ARIA (`aria-label`) and tabindex. This can lead to confusion for assistive technology users and potentially create accessibility barriers. \n\nA correct version of the code snippet would be: \n\n<`svg` `aria-hidden`=\"true\"> \n\nBy using `aria-hidden=\"true\"`, the element is completely hidden from assistive technology users, which is appropriate for a presentational element.",
  "li_aria-controls_aria-label_role": "The issue with this code snippet is that it contains elements marked as presentational that have global ARIA attributes. This can cause confusion for screen reader users and make it difficult for them to navigate the page. \n\nThe correct version of the code snippet should be: \n\n<li role=\"tab\" aria-selected=\"true\" aria-controls=\"panel1\" tabindex=\"0\"> \n\nThis code snippet adds the role of \"tab\" to the element, which helps to indicate its purpose. It also includes the aria-selected attribute to indicate that it is currently selected. Finally, it includes a tabindex of 0 to ensure that the element is focusable and can be navigated using the keyboard.",
  "ul_aria-label_role": "The issue with the code snippet is that it contains an element marked as presentational, but also has global ARIA or tabindex attributes. This can cause confusion for assistive technologies and users with disabilities. \n\nThe correct version of the code snippet would be:\n\n<ul aria-label=\"...\" role=\"list\"> \n\nThis removes the presentation role and replaces it with the appropriate role for the list element. It also removes any unnecessary global ARIA or tabindex attributes.",
  "h3_aria-label_role": "The issue with the code snippet is that it is using ARIA and role attributes to mark the element as presentational, which is not recommended. Instead, the element should simply be marked as a heading using the appropriate HTML tag (`<h3>` in this case) without any additional ARIA or tabindex attributes. \n\nThe correct version of the code snippet would be:\n\n<h3>...</h3>",
  "section_aria-labelledby_role": "The issue with this code snippet is that it contains an element marked as presentational with global ARIA or tabindex, which can cause accessibility problems for users with disabilities who rely on assistive technologies. \n\nThe correct version of the code snippet would be:\n\n<section role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"...\">\n\nBy using the role attribute with a more appropriate value, such as \"region\", we can provide more meaningful information to assistive technologies and ensure that the content is accessible to all users.",
  "li_aria-hidden_role_style": "The issue with this code snippet is that it contains an element marked as presentational (`role=\"presentation\"`) but also has a global ARIA attribute (`aria-hidden=\"false\"`) and a tabindex attribute. This can cause confusion for assistive technologies and users with disabilities. \n\nThe correct version of the code snippet would be:\n\n<li style=\"width: 100%; display: inline-block;\"></li>\n\nBy removing the unnecessary ARIA and tabindex attributes and removing the `role=\"presentation\"`, the element is now semantically correct and accessible.",
  "input_name_role_tabindex_type_value": "The issue with the code snippet is that it contains an input element with a role of \"presentation\" and a tabindex of \"-1\". This means that the element is marked as presentational and will not be accessible to assistive technologies. The correct version of the code snippet should remove the role and tabindex attributes, as they are not needed for a button element. The updated code snippet is:\n\n<input name=\"...\" type=\"button\" value=\"...\">",
  "svg_aria-labelledby_role": "The issue with the code snippet is that the `svg` element has a global ARIA attribute `aria-labelledby` and a `role` attribute set to `presentation`. This indicates that the element is being used for decorative purposes and should not be included in the accessibility tree. However, the use of global ARIA attributes can cause confusion for assistive technology users and should be avoided.\n\nCorrect version of the code snippet:\n\n<`svg` `aria-hidden`=\"true\" `role`=\"img\"> \n\nBy setting `aria-hidden` to true, the `svg` element is removed from the accessibility tree and will not be announced by assistive technology. The `role` attribute is set to `img` to indicate that the `svg` element is serving as an image.",
  "button_aria-controls_role": "The issue with the code snippet is that it is using global ARIA attributes on an element marked as presentational. This can cause confusion for screen readers and other assistive technologies. The correct version of the code snippet would be:\n\n<button aria-controls=\"accordion-item-iphone-tray\"> \n\nBy removing the unnecessary role=\"presentation\" attribute, the button will be properly recognized as a button by assistive technologies, and the aria-controls attribute will provide the necessary context for screen readers."
