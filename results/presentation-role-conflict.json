  "button_role_type_i": "The issue in the code snippet is that the button has a \"presentation\" role, which means it should not have any semantic meaning or interactivity. However, it has a \"button\" type and it may also contain global ARIA or tabindex attributes, which contradicts the \"presentation\" role.\n\nA correct version of the code snippet should remove the \"presentation\" role and allow the button to have its default semantic meaning:\n\n```html\n<button type=\"button\"><i></i></button>\n```\n\nIf the intention was to have a presentational element without interactivity, you should use a different element, like a `div` or a `span`, and remove any global ARIA or tabindex attributes:\n\n```html\n<span role=\"presentation\"><i></i></span>\n```",
  "img_alt_role_src_style_tabindex": "The issue in this code snippet is that the `img` element has a presentational role (empty `alt` attribute) but also has global ARIA attributes (`role=\"button\"`) and `tabindex=\"0\"`.\n\nTo fix the accessibility issue, you can create a separate button element to handle the interaction and wrap the `img` element inside it. Here's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```html\n<button style=\"background: none; border: none; padding: 0; cursor: pointer;\" tabindex=\"0\">\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"...\" style=\"margin-left: -12px; margin-top: -41px; width: 25px; height: 41px; transform: translate3d(538px, 200px, 0px); z-index: 200;\">\n</button>\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the `img` element is purely presentational, and the interaction is handled by the `button` element. This improves accessibility and ensures that the element works as expected for keyboard users and screen reader users."
