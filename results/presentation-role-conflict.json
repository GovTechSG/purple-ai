  "button_role_type_i": "The issue in the code snippet is that the button has a \"presentation\" role, which means it should not have any semantic meaning or interactivity. However, it has a \"button\" type and it may also contain global ARIA or tabindex attributes, which contradicts the \"presentation\" role.\n\nA correct version of the code snippet should remove the \"presentation\" role and allow the button to have its default semantic meaning:\n\n```html\n<button type=\"button\"><i></i></button>\n```\n\nIf the intention was to have a presentational element without interactivity, you should use a different element, like a `div` or a `span`, and remove any global ARIA or tabindex attributes:\n\n```html\n<span role=\"presentation\"><i></i></span>\n```"
