  "div_aria-expanded": "The issue in the given code snippet is that the `aria-expanded` attribute is not allowed on a `div` element.\n\nTo fix the issue, you can use a button element instead of a div, as the `aria-expanded` attribute is allowed on button elements. Here's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```\n<button aria-expanded=\"false\"></button>\n```",
  "div_aria-controls_aria-expanded_aria-haspopup": "The issue here is that the `div` element has ARIA attributes that are not allowed for its role. Specifically, the `aria-haspopup` attribute should be used only with elements that have a role of `button`, `menuitem`, `combobox`, or `textbox`.\n\nTo fix the issue, you can change the `div` element to a `button` element and remove the `aria-haspopup` attribute if it's not necessary. If the element should indeed open a dialog, you can keep the `aria-haspopup` attribute.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```html\n<button aria-controls=\"el-id-8872-1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-haspopup=\"dialog\">\n```\n\nIf the `div` element must remain a `div`, you can assign it a proper role and style it accordingly:\n\n```html\n<div role=\"button\" aria-controls=\"el-id-8872-1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-haspopup=\"dialog\" tabindex=\"0\">\n```\n\nIn this case, don't forget to add `tabindex=\"0\"` to make the `div` focusable and handle keyboard events for accessibility purposes.",
  "fieldset_aria-required": "The issue in the code snippet is that the `aria-required` attribute is not allowed on the `fieldset` element. Instead, you should apply the `aria-required` attribute to the individual form controls within the fieldset. Here's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```\n<fieldset>\n  <input type=\"text\" aria-required=\"true\">\n  <!-- other form controls -->\n</fieldset>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `aria-required` attribute is applied to the `input` element, which is a form control within the fieldset. Make sure to apply the `aria-required` attribute to all the required form controls within the fieldset.",
  "div_aria-label_style_tabindex_title": "The issue in the code snippet is the usage of the `aria-label` attribute on a `div` element, which is not allowed. A better alternative would be to use a more appropriate element with an inherent role, such as a `button` or `a` (anchor) element, depending on the intended functionality.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the code snippet using a `button` element:\n\n```html\n<button style=\"border: none; height: 90px; width: 728px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; background-color: transparent; display: inline-block;\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"...\" aria-label=\"...\">\n</button>\n```\n\nOr, if it's meant to be a link, you can use an `a` (anchor) element:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"#\" style=\"border: none; height: 90px; width: 728px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; background-color: transparent; display: inline-block;\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"...\" aria-label=\"...\">\n</a>\n```\n\nMake sure to adjust the `href` attribute for the anchor element or add necessary JavaScript event listeners for the button element to achieve the desired functionality.",
  "span_aria-expanded": "The issue is that the `aria-expanded` attribute is not allowed on a `span` element. To fix this, we can use a more appropriate element, such as a `button`. Here's the corrected code snippet:\n\n```html\n<button aria-expanded=\"false\">...</button>\n```\n\nNow, the `aria-expanded` attribute is correctly used with a `button` element, making it accessible.",
  "a_role=\"menuitemradio\"": "The issue in the code snippet is that the `aria-selected` attribute is not allowed for the `menuitemradio` role. Instead, the `aria-checked` attribute should be used.\n\nHere's the correct version of the code snippet:\n\n```\n<a aria-checked=\"false\" href=\"...\" role=\"menuitemradio\">\n```",
  "span_aria-sort": "The issue here is that the `aria-sort` attribute is not allowed on a `span` element. The `aria-sort` attribute should be used on elements with a role of \"columnheader\" or \"rowheader\".\n\nTo fix the issue, you can change the element to a `th` (table header) with a role of \"columnheader\" or \"rowheader\" and apply the `aria-sort` attribute to it. Here's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```html\n<th role=\"columnheader\" aria-sort=\"none\">...</th>\n```\n\nIf you still want to use a `span` element, you can wrap it inside a `th` element with the appropriate role and `aria-sort` attribute:\n\n```html\n<th role=\"columnheader\" aria-sort=\"none\"><span>...</span></th>\n```",
  "mat-chip-list_aria-disabled_aria-invalid_aria-label_aria-multiselectable_aria-orientation_tabindex": "The issue in the given code snippet is the use of `aria-disabled`, `aria-invalid`, and `aria-multiselectable` attributes on a `mat-chip-list` element. These ARIA attributes are not allowed for this element's role.\n\nThe correct version of the code snippet should be:\n\n```\n<mat-chip-list aria-label=\"...\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n```"
