  "select_name": "The issue with the given code snippet is that it lacks a proper label for the select element, which is important for accessibility. Screen readers rely on labels to provide context and information to users about the purpose of form elements.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the code snippet with a proper label:\n\n```html\n<label for=\"exampleSelect\">Example Label:</label>\n<select name=\"exampleSelect\" id=\"exampleSelect\">\n  <!-- Add your option elements here -->\n</select>\n```\n\nIn this example, we've added a `<label>` element with a `for` attribute that matches the `id` attribute of the `<select>` element. This ensures that the label is associated with the select element, improving accessibility for users relying on screen readers."
