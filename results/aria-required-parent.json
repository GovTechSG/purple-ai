  "a_role=\"tab\"": "The issue in the code snippet is that the `role=\"tab\"` is not contained within an element with `role=\"tablist\"`. To fix this issue, you should wrap the anchor tag with a parent element that has the required role \"tablist\". Here's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```\n<div role=\"tablist\">\n  <a aria-controls=\"full-fsbb-today\" aria-selected=\"true\" href=\"...\" role=\"tab\"></a>\n</div>\n```",
  "button_role=\"tab\"": "The issue here is that the ARIA role \"tab\" requires a parent element with the role \"tablist\". To fix this, we need to wrap the button element inside a div with the role \"tablist\".

  "a_role=\"menuitemradio\"": "The issue in the given code snippet is that the \"menuitemradio\" role requires a parent element with the \"menu\" or \"menubar\" role. To fix the issue, you can wrap the \"a\" element inside an element with the \"menu\" role.

  "label_role=\"option\"": "The issue with the code snippet is that the `role` attribute \"option\" is not a valid ARIA role for a `label` element. The correct ARIA role for a `label` element is \"label\". Additionally, the `option` role should only be used for elements that are options within a listbox or combobox. \n\nThe corrected code snippet would be: \n\n<label aria-disabled=\"false\" for=\"selected-1b3ugLwn5bE8g63bj6CLVW\" role=\"label\">",
  "a_role=\"menuitem\"": "The issue with the code snippet is that the `role` attribute \"menuitem\" is not contained within a parent role of \"menu\".
