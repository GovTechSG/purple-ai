To fix this, you can add an `aria-label` attribute that provides a descriptive name for the toggle fields.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```html\n<div aria-describedby=\"...\" aria-hidden=\"false\" role=\"option\" style=\"width: 900px;\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-label=\"Descriptive name for the toggle field\">\n```\n\nMake sure to replace \"Descriptive name for the toggle field\" with an appropriate name that describes the purpose of the toggle field."
