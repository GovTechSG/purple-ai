The \"presentation\" role is used to remove the semantic meaning of an element, which is not suitable for a button.

  "form_role=\"form\"": "The issue in the given code snippet is that the role attribute has an inappropriate value. The `form` element already has a default role of \"form\", so it is unnecessary to add a role attribute with the same value. To fix this, simply remove the role attribute from the `form` element.\n\nCorrected code snippet:\n\n```\n<form>\n```",
  "input_role=\"button\"": "The issue in the given code snippet is that the `role` attribute has an inappropriate value. The element is an `input` with a `type` of \"checkbox\", but the `role` is set to \"button\". The correct role for a checkbox input should be \"checkbox\".\n\nHere's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```html\n<input aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-label=\"...\" role=\"checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\">\n```",

  "iframe_role=\"region\"": "The issue in the given code snippet is that the `role` attribute is set to \"region\" for an `iframe` element. The \"region\" role is not appropriate for an `iframe`. Instead, you should use the \"document\" or \"application\" role for an `iframe` depending on its content.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```\n<iframe aria-label=\"...\" name=\"...\" role=\"document\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"...\"></iframe>\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the `role` attribute is set to \"document\". If the content of the `iframe` is more like an application, you can use `role=\"application\"` instead.",
  "section_role=\"tablist\"": "The issue in the given code snippet is that the `role` attribute has an inappropriate value \"tablist\" for the `section` element. A `section` element should not have a \"tablist\" role as it is not semantically correct. The \"tablist\" role should be used with a `div` or similar container element that holds a group of tabs.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```\n<div role=\"tablist\">\n  <section>\n    <!-- Your content here -->\n  </section>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, I have wrapped the `section` element inside a `div` element and assigned the \"tablist\" role to the `div` element. Now, the `section` element can be used to represent a tab panel, while the `div` element with the \"tablist\" role will act as a container for the group of tabs.",
  "textarea_role=\"combobox\"": "The issue in the code snippet is that the `role` attribute is set to \"combobox\" on a `textarea` element. A combobox role should be associated with an input element, not a textarea element. Also, the `type` attribute is not valid for a textarea element.

The `tabindex` attribute is moved to the `button` element, and some additional styling is added to the `button` to remove its default appearance.",
  "li_role=\"tabpanel\"": "The issue in the given code snippet is that the role attribute has an inappropriate value. The role \"tabpanel\" should be used with a `div` element instead of an `li` element. \n\nHere's the correct version of the code snippet:\n\n```html\n<div aria-label=\"...\" aria-roledescription=\"slide\" role=\"tabpanel\" style=\"width: calc(100%);\">\n  <ul>\n    <li>...</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, I have wrapped the `li` element inside a `ul` element and placed them inside a `div` element with the appropriate role attribute value \"tabpanel\".",

If the parent list container has a role of \"list\", the `li` elements will be automatically recognized as list items by screen readers.",
  "a_role=\"article\"": "The issue here is that the `role` attribute has an inappropriate value for an anchor (`a`) element. The `role` attribute should have a value that matches the purpose of the element. In this case, since it's a link, the correct role should be \"link\". Here's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```\n<a href=\"...\" role=\"link\">\n```\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the \"link\" role is implicit for anchor elements with an `href` attribute, so you can simply omit the `role` attribute:\n\n```\n<a href=\"...\">\n```",
  "iframe_src_title": "The issue in the given code snippet is that it does not have a proper role attribute for the iframe element. To fix the accessibility issue, we should add a role attribute with a value of \"presentation\" or \"document\", depending on the purpose of the iframe.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\nFor presentation:\n```html\n<iframe src=\"...\" title=\"...\" role=\"presentation\"></iframe>\n```\n\nFor document:\n```html\n<iframe src=\"...\" title=\"...\" role=\"document\"></iframe>\n```\n\nChoose the appropriate role based on the purpose of the iframe in your application.",

This way, the element's role as a button is appropriately conveyed while still preserving the heading structure.",
  "footer_role=\"region\"": "The issue in the code snippet is that the `footer` element has an inappropriate value for the `role` attribute.
