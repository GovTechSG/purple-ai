  "div_aria-hidden_style": "The issue in the code snippet is that the `aria-hidden` attribute is set to \"true\" on an element that contains focusable elements or is focusable itself. This can cause confusion for screen reader users, as the focusable elements inside the hidden content will still be reachable and announced, even though they are not visible on the screen.\n\nTo fix the issue, you should either remove the focusable elements from the hidden content or make them non-focusable by adding `tabindex=\"-1\"` to each focusable element. Alternatively, you can remove the `aria-hidden` attribute if the content should be accessible.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```html\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"width: 394px;\">\n  <!-- Non-focusable content goes here -->\n  <button tabindex=\"-1\">Sample Button</button>\n  <a href=\"#\" tabindex=\"-1\">Sample Link</a>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, I've added `tabindex=\"-1\"` to the focusable elements (button and link) inside the hidden content, making them non-focusable.",

The button remains focusable, and screen reader users will now be able to access it as well.",

You can achieve this by adding the `tabindex=\"-1\"` attribute to the focusable elements.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```html\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\">\n  <!-- Add tabindex=\"-1\" to focusable elements inside the aria-hidden container -->\n  <button tabindex=\"-1\">Sample Button</button>\n  <a href=\"#\" tabindex=\"-1\">Sample Link</a>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the focusable elements (button and link) inside the `aria-hidden=\"true\"` container have the `tabindex=\"-1\"` attribute added, making them unfocusable and preventing them from being reached via keyboard navigation.",
