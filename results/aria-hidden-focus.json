  "div_aria-hidden_style": "The issue in the code snippet is that the `aria-hidden` attribute is set to \"true\" on an element that contains focusable elements or is focusable itself. This can cause confusion for screen reader users, as the focusable elements inside the hidden content will still be reachable and announced, even though they are not visible on the screen.\n\nTo fix the issue, you should either remove the focusable elements from the hidden content or make them non-focusable by adding `tabindex=\"-1\"` to each focusable element. Alternatively, you can remove the `aria-hidden` attribute if the content should be accessible.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```html\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"width: 394px;\">\n  <!-- Non-focusable content goes here -->\n  <button tabindex=\"-1\">Sample Button</button>\n  <a href=\"#\" tabindex=\"-1\">Sample Link</a>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, I've added `tabindex=\"-1\"` to the focusable elements (button and link) inside the hidden content, making them non-focusable.",
  "li_aria-controls_aria-hidden_aria-selected_role_button_role_tabindex_type": "The issue in the code snippet is that the element with `aria-hidden=\"true\"` contains a focusable element (the button). This means that screen readers will skip the content, but keyboard users can still focus on it, causing confusion.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```\n<li aria-controls=\"navigation00\" role=\"presentation\">\n  <button role=\"button\" type=\"button\"></button>\n</li>\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, I removed the `aria-hidden=\"true\"` and `aria-selected=\"true\"` attributes from the `li` element, as they are not necessary in this context. The button remains focusable, and screen reader users will now be able to access it as well.",
  "li_aria-hidden_style_a_href_img_alt_src": "The issue in the given code snippet is that the `li` element has `aria-hidden=\"true\"` attribute, which means it should be hidden from screen readers, but it contains a focusable element (`a` element). This can cause confusion for screen reader users.\n\nTo fix the issue, you can add `tabindex=\"-1\"` to the `a` element to make it non-focusable. Here's the corrected code snippet:\n\n```\n<li aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"height: 162.424px;\">\n  <a href=\"...\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n    <img alt=\"icon\" src=\"...\">\n  </a>\n</li>\n```",
  "div_aria-hidden": "The issue in the given code snippet is that the `aria-hidden=\"true\"` attribute is applied to an element that is focusable or contains focusable elements. This can lead to confusion for screen reader users, as the focusable elements will still be reachable via keyboard navigation, but will not be announced by the screen reader.\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that focusable elements inside the `aria-hidden=\"true\"` container are not focusable. You can achieve this by adding the `tabindex=\"-1\"` attribute to the focusable elements.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```html\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\">\n  <!-- Add tabindex=\"-1\" to focusable elements inside the aria-hidden container -->\n  <button tabindex=\"-1\">Sample Button</button>\n  <a href=\"#\" tabindex=\"-1\">Sample Link</a>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the focusable elements (button and link) inside the `aria-hidden=\"true\"` container have the `tabindex=\"-1\"` attribute added, making them unfocusable and preventing them from being reached via keyboard navigation."
