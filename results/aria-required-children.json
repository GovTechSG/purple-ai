  "ul_role=\"tablist\"": "The issue in the given code snippet is that the `ul` element with the `role` of \"tablist\" is missing the required child elements with the `role` of \"tab\". To fix this issue, you should add the required child elements with the appropriate ARIA roles. Here's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```html\n<ul role=\"tablist\">\n  <li role=\"tab\">Tab 1</li>\n  <li role=\"tab\">Tab 2</li>\n  <li role=\"tab\">Tab 3</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the `li` elements have been given the required `role` of \"tab\" as children of the `ul` element with the `role` of \"tablist\".",
  "div_role=\"list\"": "The issue here is that the \"list\" role requires its child elements to have the \"listitem\" role. The correct version of the code snippet should look like this:\n\n```\n<div aria-label=\"...\" role=\"list\">\n  <div role=\"listitem\">Item 1</div>\n  <div role=\"listitem\">Item 2</div>\n  <div role=\"listitem\">Item 3</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, each child element within the \"list\" role container has the appropriate \"listitem\" role."
