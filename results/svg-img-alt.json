This means that users with visual impairments who rely on screen readers will not be able to understand the purpose of the image. \n\nTo fix this issue, the code snippet should be updated to include an accessible text using the aria-label attribute. The corrected code snippet is:\n\n<svg role=\"img\" aria-label=\"Avatar icon\">\n  <use href=\"#st-icon-avatar\"></use>\n</svg>"
