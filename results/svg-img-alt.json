  "svg_aria-labelledby_role_xlink": "The issue with this code snippet is that it contains an <svg> element with an aria-labelledby attribute but the accessible text is not provided. This can make the content inaccessible to users who rely on screen readers.\n\nThe correct version of the code snippet should include an aria-labelledby attribute with a corresponding ID that references a text element containing the accessible text. For example:\n\n<`svg` `aria-labelledby`=\"myLabel\" `role`=\"img\" `xlink`=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\n  <`desc` id=\"myLabel\">Accessible text goes here</`desc`>\n  <!-- SVG graphics go here -->\n</`svg`>",
  "svg_role_use_href": "The issue with this code snippet is that the <svg> element with the role of \"img\" does not have an accessible text. This means that users with visual impairments who rely on screen readers will not be able to understand the purpose of the image. \n\nTo fix this issue, the code snippet should be updated to include an accessible text using the aria-label attribute. The corrected code snippet is:\n\n<svg role=\"img\" aria-label=\"Avatar icon\">\n  <use href=\"#st-icon-avatar\"></use>\n</svg>",
  "svg_aria-label_role_style": "The issue with this code snippet is that it only includes an aria-label attribute for accessibility, but it does not provide any accessible text for the img, graphics-document or graphics-symbol-role elements. This means that users who rely on assistive technology to access the content may not be able to understand the meaning of these elements.\n\nThe correct version of the code snippet should include an accessible text description for each img, graphics-document or graphics-symbol-role element, using the aria-labelledby or aria-describedby attribute. For example:\n\n<`svg` `role`=\"img\" `style`=\"font-family: Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">\n  <`image` `xlink:href`=\"image.png\" `alt`=\"Description of the image for accessibility\" />\n  <`desc` `id`=\"img-desc\">Description of the image for accessibility</`desc`>\n</`svg`>\n\nIn this updated code snippet, the `image` element includes an `alt` attribute with a description of the image for accessibility. The `desc` element provides an additional accessible text description for the image, using the `id` attribute to link it to the `image` element using the `aria-describedby` attribute. This ensures that users who rely on assistive technology can access the content and understand its meaning.",
  "svg_ariahidden_role": "The issue with the code snippet is that it does not have an accessible text for the <svg> element. This can make it difficult for visually impaired users to understand the content. \n\nThe correct version of the code snippet should include an accessible text using the `aria-label` attribute.
