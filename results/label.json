To fix this, you should add a label element with a \"for\" attribute that matches the input element's \"id\" attribute. Here's the correct version of the code snippet:\n\n```html\n<label for=\"inputId\">Label text:</label>\n<input id=\"inputId\" tabindex=\"0\" value=\"...\">\n```\n\nMake sure to replace \"Label text\" with the appropriate label for the input field, and \"inputId\" with a unique identifier for the input element.",

To fix this issue, you can add a label element with a \"for\" attribute that matches the input element's \"id\" attribute. Here's the corrected version of the code snippet:\n\n```\n<label for=\"number-input\">Number:</label>\n<input type=\"number\" id=\"number-input\">\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, a label element is added with the text \"Number:\". The \"for\" attribute in the label element is set to \"number-input\", which matches the \"id\" attribute of the input element. This way, screen readers and other assistive technologies can properly associate the label with the input field.",
