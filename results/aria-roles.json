However, if you want to provide a specific role, you can use a valid ARIA role value. For example, if the `iframe` is used as a presentation or a region, you can use the `role` attribute with the value \"presentation\" or \"region\".\n\n```html\n<!-- Without role attribute (recommended) -->\n<iframe src=\"...\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" title=\"...\"></iframe>\n\n<!-- With role attribute (optional) -->\n<iframe role=\"presentation\" src=\"...\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" title=\"...\"></iframe>\n```\n\n**Valid ARIA Role Values:**\n\nYou can refer to the WAI-ARIA specification for a complete list of valid role values. Some common role values include:\n\n* `application`\n* `banner`\n* `complementary`\n* `contentinfo`\n* `definition`\n* `dialog`\n* `directory`\n* `document`\n* `feed`\n* `figure`\n* `form`\n* `grid`\n* `group`\n* `heading`\n* `img`\n* `link`\n* `list`\n* `listbox`\n* `main`\n* `marquee`\n* `math`\n* `menu`\n* `menubar`\n* `navigation`\n* `none`\n* `note`\n* `presentation`\n* `progress`\n* `radio`\n* `radiogroup`\n* `region`\n* `row`\n* `rowgroup`\n* `search`\n* `searchbox`\n* `separator`\n* `slider`\n* `spinbutton"
